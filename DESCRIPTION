Description: R package for building end-to-end analysis pipelines with automated report generation for next generation sequence (NGS) applications such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and many others. An important feature is support for running command-line software, such as NGS aligners, on both single machines or compute clusters. This includes both interactive job submissions or batch submissions to queuing systems of clusters.
Depends: Rsamtools, Biostrings, ShortRead, methods
Imports: BiocGenerics, rjson, grid, ggplot2, limma, edgeR, GOstats, GO.db, annotate, pheatmap, BatchJobs
Suggests: ape, RUnit, BiocStyle, biomaRt, GenomicFeatures, BiocParallel
SystemRequirements: systemPipeR can be used to run external command-line software (e.g. short read aligners), but the corresponding tool needs to be installed on a system.
